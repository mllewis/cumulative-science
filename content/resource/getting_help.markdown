* Look at the help files (` ?<function>` in RStudio console)
* Look at the [cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
* Google – often adding “tidyverse” to your search helps
* Often it's a lot more pleasant an experience to get your questions answered in person. Make use of office hours, we're here to help!
* Email us 
* When getting help from us, give your question context from course concepts not course assignments.
    - Good context: "I have a question on filtering"
    - Bad context: "I have a question on Assignment 1 Exercise 4”
* Be precise in your description:
    - Good description: "I am getting the following error and I'm not sure how to resolve it  '-Error: could not find function read_csv'"
    - Bad description: "R giving errors, help me! Aaaarrrrrgh!”
