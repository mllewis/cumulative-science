title: "Meta-Analysis Final Project"
slug: finalproject
---

For the remaining portion of the semester, we will be working on your final projects -- an original meta-analysis on a question in developmental, cognitive, or social psychology. You will complete your project in groups of ~4, and you will decide on your topic in consultation with me and your group members. The goal is that you could go on to publish your meta-analysis with a little more work beyond this class.

There are broadly five steps to conducting a meta-analysis: 

1. Identify topic
2. Conduct literature search
3. Code studies and calculate effect sizes
4. Plot and analyze data
5. Report and discuss results.

You will conduct your meta-analysis as a group, but you will write-up your results in a final paper *individually* (each student must turn in their own final paper). In the following weeks, you will complete three more assignments (Assignments 6-8). Each assignment will involve completing one of the above steps for your meta-analysis. Assignment 6 will involve identifying a topic for your MA, Assignment 7 will involve conducting a literature search for your MA, and Assignment 8 will involve coding studies for your MA. Each of these three assignments will involve a written component that will become part of your final paper that you turn in at the end of the semester.

We will provide feedback to you for each assignment and *you must incorporate this feedback* in your final paper. After completing Assignments 6-8, you'll almost have a complete paper -- the only additional things you'll need to add are plots and analyses of your data and a discussion of your results.  Finally, you will share your final results in a presentation during the last week of class. Your presentation will be as a group. 

More detailed expectations are described below.


# Final Project Paper

Your paper write-up of your project will use a package called [Papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) that provides a template for writing papers in APA format using R Markdown. The template allows you to write your final paper and include your R code and output in a single document, making your report highly reproducible. The template is provided here. Your final paper is due **May 8th (5pm)**. It should include the following components:


Introduction to your MA:

* -4-6 pages 
- -introduce the question your MA addresses and why it is important
* -introduce seminal paper (method, finding, results)

Methods:

* -paper selection method (inclusion criteria)
* -description of variables coded
* -effect size measure

Results:

* -forest plot
* -funnel plot
* -grand mean effect size
* -moderators 
  
Discussion:

* -2-3 pages
* -summary of findings
* -interpretation - What do your findings mean? How does the grand effect size compare to other effects in psychology and in your domain?

In addition to the content of your meta-analysis, your paper will be evaluated for the clarity of the writing. 

# Final Project Presentation

Presentations will be the week of **April 27th**. Details TBD.

<!--* -Should be 10 minutes in length, 5 additional minutes for questions
* -Should broadly follow the same structure as your final paper
* -Use google slides -->
