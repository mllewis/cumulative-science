title: "Meta-Analysis Final Project"
slug: finalproject
---



<p>For the remaining portion of the semester, we will be working on your final projects – an original meta-analysis on a question in developmental, cognitive, or social psychology. You will complete your project in groups of ~4, and you will decide on your topic in consultation with me and your group members. The goal is that you could go on to publish your meta-analysis with a little more work beyond this class.</p>
<p>There are broadly five steps to conducting a meta-analysis:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify topic</li>
<li>Conduct literature search</li>
<li>Code studies and calculate effect sizes</li>
<li>Plot and analyze data</li>
<li>Report and discuss results.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will conduct your meta-analysis as a group, but you will write-up your results in a final paper <em>individually</em> (each student must turn in their own final paper). In the following weeks, you will complete three more assignments (Assignments 6-8). Each assignment will involve completing one of the above steps for your meta-analysis. Assignment 6 will involve identifying a topic for your MA, Assignment 7 will involve conducting a literature search for your MA, and Assignment 8 will involve coding studies for your MA. Each of these three assignments will involve a written component that will become part of your final paper that you turn in at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>We will provide feedback to you for each assignment and <em>you must incorporate this feedback</em> in your final paper. After completing Assignments 6-8, you’ll almost have a complete paper – the only additional things you’ll need to add are plots and analyses of your data and a discussion of your results. Finally, you will share your final results in a presentation during the last week of class. Your presentation will be as a group.</p>
<p>More detailed expectations are described below.</p>
<h2 id="final-project-paper">Final Project Paper</h2>
<p>Your paper write-up of your project will use a package called <a href="https://github.com/crsh/papaja">Papaja</a> that provides a template for writing papers in APA format using R Markdown. The template allows you to write your final paper and include your R code and output in a single document, making your report highly reproducible. The template is provided here. Your final paper is due <strong>May 8th (5pm)</strong>. It should include the following components:</p>
<p>Introduction to your MA:</p>
<ul>
<li>-4-6 pages</li>
<li>-introduce the question your MA addresses and why it is important</li>
<li>-introduce seminal paper (method, finding, results)</li>
</ul>
<p>Methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>-paper selection method (inclusion criteria)</li>
<li>-description of variables coded</li>
<li>-effect size measure</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>-forest plot</li>
<li>-funnel plot</li>
<li>-grand mean effect size</li>
<li>-moderators</li>
</ul>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>-2-3 pages</li>
<li>-summary of findings</li>
<li>-interpretation - What do your findings mean? How does the grand effect size compare to other effects in psychology and in your domain?</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the content of your meta-analysis, your paper will be evaluated for a effectively you communicate your ideas (i.e., the clarity of the writing).</p>
<h2 id="final-project-presentation">Final Project Presentation</h2>
<p>Presentations will be the week of <strong>April 27th</strong>. Details TBD.</p>
<!--* -Should be 10 minutes in length, 5 additional minutes for questions
* -Should broadly follow the same structure as your final paper
* -Use google slides -->
