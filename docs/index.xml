      <description>Contents  Things we’ll do Mixed strategies   Things we’ll do  Calculate mixed strategies in games Review concepts that are covered in Problem Set 1  Mixed strategies When there is no single Nash equilibrium in a game, players have to engage in a mixed strategy and attempt to predict what the other players will do. The choices they make are determined by the payoffs in the game, since it is generally more likely that players will choose strategies that maximize their payoffs.</description>

Lab Assignments There will be 8 Lab Assignments throughout the semester. The goal of these assignments is to give you hands-on experience with the skills that are introduced in lecture and in lab. You are welcomed, and encouraged, to work with each other on the problems. But, you must turn in your own work.

      <description>Course Objectives The course has two related goals: (1) Provide a theoretical understanding of the scientific process and the role of cumulative science, and (2) introduce you to a set of modern tools for conducting science in this framework. Specifically, you’ll be able to:
 Understand the basic principles of experimental design and the cumulative scientific process Use R/RStudio and the tidyverse framework (Wickham, 2017) for conducting basic data analysis Present visualizations of data using Grammar of Graphics principles (Wickham, 2010) Implement reproducible workflows Conduct a basic meta-analysis  In addition, the course will introduce you to a range of other tools (Github, Rpubs, Open Science Framework, web experimental frameworks, metafor) that are useful in psychological research.</description>
