```{r, fig.cap = "This figures shows...", fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
# Example figure
my_prisma_plot <- prisma2(found = 500, # how many unique papers did you find through database searches (google scholar/jstor)?
        found_other = 10,  # how many papers did you find through other sources?
        screened = 503, # how many of those papers did you screen by looking at the title/abstract?
        screen_exclusions = 400, # how many of those papers that you screened did you exclude?
        full_text = 103, # how many papers did you look at the full text for?
        full_text_exclusions = 75, # how many papers did you exclude after looking at the ful text?
        quantitative = 30, # how many papers went in your final meta-analysis
        width = 800, height = 800)
